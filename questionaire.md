There are 3 people who responded on the questionaire.
Almost all of the answers to the questions were positive and did not provide any indication of possible improvement of the documentation.

For the question `Could You run the docker operations on all containers?` everyone answered `No user given` which indicates that our communication
on how to log on to the server possibly wasn't clear enough. We told them we could hand over a private key for them to use if they contacted us through Keybase.
This might have been misunderstood or they completely missed the message.

On the question `If You have some comments on how to improve our Ops documentation, please let us know below :)` there was one answer:
`Better grammar.` which is pretty useless unless you point out in what document or section you've found bad grammar.`
